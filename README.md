# Lancashire-Food-Bank-App
I designed this single page app as a self-help intranet to be placed on devices in food banks across Lancashire. Initially added media queries to make fully responsive but as the UI is fixed to regular monitor size, this approach was abandoned. I have, however, decided to leave most of the mobile responsive styling in the code should the criteria change.
